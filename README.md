## About this repo

This is my repo for **STATS 220**.

## A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in *Communication and Technology*.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to:
  1. Develop a strong foundation in data analysis and statistical thinking.
  2. Better understand digital communication trends.
- I am interested in learning about how data can improve user engagement and analyze communication patterns in the digital age.
